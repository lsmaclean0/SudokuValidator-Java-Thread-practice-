Sudoku Validator 

===========================


I included a copy of the Jar file in the main directory so you can launch from the terminal 
or from an IDE. This application reads in a sudoku board from a text file "hard.txt" 
then inserts the numbers into a 2d array that it later uses to solve the puzzle.
